daily practice with data structure and algorithm  
programming language: JavaScript

# Array ✅
- reversing array
- removing duplicates
- sorting an array
- finding max/min

# Linked List ✅
- creating a linked list
- adding node to front/end
- finding the middle element (using fast/slow pointer)
- reversing a linked list
- searching value
- delete node by selecting value
- merging two sorted linked lists (dummy node)
- palindrome check (two pointers + reverse linked list)

# Stack ✅
- implementing stack with array
- isBalanced parentheses check
- reversing a string using stack

# Queue ✅
- implementing queue with array
- generating binary numbers (enqueue + binary strings)
- finding first non-repeating character (frequency map + queue)

# Stack + Queue ✅
- palindrome check using both stack and queue
- interleaving the first and second half of a queue
- implementing queue using two stacks
- custom display logic for queue implemented with stacks

# Object / Map ✅
- word frequency counter
- first non-repeating character
